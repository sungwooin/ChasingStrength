    <h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Prince</h3>
    <p>I used to be skinny, weak, and constantly tired. I had no idea where to start, no confidence in my body â€” just a desire to change. So I did. Step by step.</p>
    <p>This platform isn't just a brand. It's my story. It's for every student or working person out there who thinks it's too late or too hard. Trust me â€” it isnâ€™t.</p>
    <p>I created ChasingStrength to share everything Iâ€™ve learned and help others transform without burning a hole in their pocket. All my plans are budget-friendly â€” even teenagers can afford them. Iâ€™m here to help and earn some honest pocket money along the way.</p>
