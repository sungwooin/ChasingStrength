    <h2 class="section-title">My Journey: From Skinny to Strong 🚀</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          ChasingStrength started with my personal fitness journey. I was once skinny and weak, struggling to build muscle and confidence. But through discipline, hard work, and a passion for learning, I transformed my body and mind. 💪
        </p>
        <p>
          I faced many challenges along the way. The initial struggle with self-doubt, failed attempts at different diets, and constantly feeling out of place at the gym. But I didn't let that stop me. I focused on consistency, learning from my mistakes, and never giving up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I discovered the power of proper nutrition, effective workouts, and a mindset that embraced failure as part of growth. I learned how to push through plateaus, set realistic goals, and, most importantly, build resilience that went beyond just physical strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I'm proud to say that I'm stronger, healthier, and more confident than ever. And now, it's my mission to help others achieve the same transformation. Whether you're starting from scratch or trying to break through a fitness plateau, I’m here to guide you every step of the way.
