            <h3>2021: The Beginning 🌱</h3>
            <p>It all started in 2021 when I was determined to change my life. At the time, I was dealing with a number of health challenges, but I knew I had to make a change. My journey began with small, consistent steps towards better health and fitness.</p>

            <h3>2021: A Setback 🦠</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, my health journey was interrupted when I battled dengue 🦠 and malaria 🤒, which left me weak and at 52 kg, with little strength to move forward. But I wasn’t ready to give up just yet!</p>

          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>2022: Resilience and Progress 💥</h3>
            <p>Despite everything, I picked myself back up. I started training again, and although progress was slow, I remained determined. The ups and downs were real, but so was the belief that if you don’t give up, you’ll eventually reach your goal.</p>
