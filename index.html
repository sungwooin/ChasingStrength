      <p>I used to be skinny and weak — unsure of myself and my body. But I decided to take action, learn, and transform myself through training, nutrition, and mindset. Now, I want to help *you* take that step too.</p>
      <p><strong>ChasingStrength</strong> was born from that journey. It's more than a brand — it's a mission to empower students and professionals to build strength, inside and out.</p>
