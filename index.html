      <h2 class="section-header">About Me & Why I Started</h2>
      <p>Hey, I’m Prince — the guy behind ChasingStrength. I wasn’t born athletic. In fact, I started out weak, underconfident, and confused about fitness. But I decided to change. I trained, studied, failed, tried again — and built myself from the ground up.</p>
      <p>This site is not just a portfolio of what I’ve learned; it’s a hub for you to grow too. My goal is to help students and working individuals — just like you — get stronger, fitter, and more confident through training, without burning a hole in their pocket.</p>
      <p>I priced my coaching between ₹100 - ₹1000 because I want it to be affordable. Everyone deserves to feel strong. Let’s chase strength together!</p>
